    <h1>Improved User Experience</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Simplifying Authentication for Users </strong></li>
      <li>
        Passwordless systems dramatically simplify the login process, offering a
        seamless and intuitive experience for users. Unlike traditional
        passwords, which require users to create, remember, and manage complex
        combinations, passwordless methods eliminate these pain points. This
        simplification improves accessibility and ensures users can log in
        quickly and efficiently, even across multiple platforms and devices.
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. No More Password Fatigue </strong></li>
      <li>
        Password fatigue is a common issue, especially for users who are
        required to maintain different credentials for various accounts.
        Remembering multiple passwords or constantly resetting them is
        frustrating and time-consuming. Passwordless systems, such as biometric
        authentication or hardware tokens, remove the need for this entirely. A
        simple scan of a fingerprint or face is all thatâ€™s needed to access an
        account, reducing stress and improving user satisfaction.
      </li>
      <li><strong>3. Faster and Frictionless Logins </strong></li>
      <li>
        With passwordless systems, logins are faster and more streamlined.
        Biometric methods, such as Face ID or fingerprint scanning, take mere
        seconds, and hardware tokens or cryptographic passkeys offer instant
        authentication. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in
        workplaces, where saving even a few seconds per login can cumulatively
        lead to significant productivity gains.
      </li>
      <li><strong> 4. Increased Accessibility for All Users </strong></li>
      <li>
        Passwordless systems also improve accessibility for individuals with
        disabilities or those who find typing difficult. Using biometrics or
        simple token-based logins ensures a smoother experience for everyone,
        emphasizing inclusivity alongside security.
