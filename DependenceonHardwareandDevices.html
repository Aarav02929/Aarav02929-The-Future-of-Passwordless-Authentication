    <h1>Dependence on Hardware and Devices</h1>
    <p>
      Passwordless authentication often relies on hardware devices or specific
      user devices to verify identity, which introduces certain challenges
      related to device dependency and access continuity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Loss or Theft of Hardware Keys</strong></li>
      <li>
        Hardware tokens, such as YubiKey or Google Titan Security Key, are
        popular tools for passwordless authentication. However, if a user loses
        or misplaces their hardware token, they may be unable to access their
        accounts, leading to disruptions.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong></li>
      <li>
        If a hardware token is stolen, there is a risk that an unauthorized
        party may attempt to misuse it, especially if the token is not paired
        with additional security measures like biometric confirmation.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Solution</strong></li>
      <li>
        Organizations can implement backup recovery methods to mitigate these
        risks, such as:
      </li>
      <li>
        Biometric Fallback: Allow users to authenticate with facial recognition
        or fingerprints.
      </li>
      <li>
        Emergency One-Time Passcodes (OTPs): Issue temporary access codes
        through secure channels, such as registered email or authentication
        apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Multi-Device Registration: Permit users to register multiple devices for
        authentication redundancy.
      </li>
      <li><strong> Device Dependency</strong></li>
      <li>
        Passwordless methods like biometric authentication and cryptographic
        keys are often tied to a userâ€™s device (e.g., smartphone, laptop). If
        users change, lose, or damage their devices, they may face access
        disruptions.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Challenges</strong></li>
      <li>
        Users upgrading their phones or laptops may need to reconfigure
        authentication methods.
      </li>
      <li>
        In remote work scenarios, device failures can hinder productivity if no
        backup solutions exist.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Solution</strong></li>
      <li>To address device dependency:</li>
      <li>
        Implement cloud-based recovery to allow users to restore authentication
        credentials on new devices securely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use cross-device authentication options, such as linking authentication
        tools across smartphones, tablets, and hardware tokens.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While hardware and device dependency add complexity to passwordless
      systems, robust recovery mechanisms and backup solutions ensure
      reliability and user convenience while maintaining strong security.
