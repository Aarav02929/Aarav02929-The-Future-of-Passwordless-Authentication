    <h1>Adoption and Compatibility of Passwordless Systems</h1>

    <p>
      Transitioning to passwordless authentication requires significant changes
      at both the user and organizational levels. While the benefits are clear,
      challenges related to legacy systems and user adaptation can slow
      adoption.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1. Compatibility with Legacy Systems </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Older systems, applications, and infrastructure may not support modern
        passwordless authentication standards like FIDO2 and WebAuthn. Many
        organizations still rely on legacy software that is deeply integrated
        into their workflows, and upgrading such systems can be time-consuming
        and costly.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Challenges</strong></li>
      <li>
        Legacy systems lack support for cryptographic keys, biometrics, or
        device-based authentication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Businesses may face downtime or disruption when modernizing their
        infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Solution: </strong></li>
      <li>
        Implement gradual migration strategies that allow dual compatibility
        with both password-based and passwordless methods.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use tools like identity and access management (IAM) platforms to bridge
        modern authentication standards with older systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prioritize critical systems for upgrades while ensuring minimal
        disruption to business operations.
      </li>
      <li><strong>2. User Adaptation </strong></li>
      <li>
        Users accustomed to traditional passwords may resist adopting new
        methods like hardware tokens, biometric scans, or passkeys due to
        unfamiliarity or perceived complexity.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Solution</strong></li>
      <li>
        Provide clear instructions and user-friendly onboarding processes to
        demonstrate how passwordless systems work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Offer training sessions and highlight benefits such as improved
        security, faster logins, and reduced password fatigue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow users to experience both methods initially, building confidence
        before fully transitioning to passwordless authentication.
      </li>
      <li>
        By addressing compatibility and user adaptation challenges with
        strategic planning and education, organizations can ensure a smoother
        transition to secure, passwordless systems.
      </li>
