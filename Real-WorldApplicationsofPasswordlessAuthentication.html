    <h1>Real-World Applications of Passwordless Authentication</h1>
    <p>
      Passwordless authentication is revolutionizing how organizations secure
      access to systems and applications, with major technology companies at the
      forefront of this transformation. By eliminating passwords, businesses
      address some of the most common vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, such as
      phishing, credential stuffing, and password leaks, while offering users a
      faster and frictionless login experience.

    <p>
      <strong>Why Companies Are Adopting Passwordless Authentication </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Traditional passwords have long been a weak link in security systems.
        Users struggle to create and remember complex passwords, often reusing
        them across platforms. This creates opportunities for cybercriminals to
        exploit stolen credentials. Passwordless authentication offers a
        solution by:
      </li>
      <li>
        Relying on biometric verification (e.g., fingerprints, face scans).
      </li>
      <li>Leveraging hardware security tokens or cryptographic passkeys.</li>
      <li>
        Reducing reliance on centralized password databases, which are prime
        targets for breaches.
      </li>
      <li>
        By addressing these weaknesses, passwordless systems improve both
        security and user satisfaction, making them attractive to companies
        operating in high-risk industries like technology, finance, and
        healthcare.
