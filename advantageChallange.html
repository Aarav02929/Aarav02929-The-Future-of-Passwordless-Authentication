    <h1>Adavantages and Challenges</h1>
    <p class="c">
      Passwordless authentication has emerged as a modern solution to the
      limitations of traditional password-based systems, offering substantial
      improvements in both security and user experience. By eliminating
      passwords, it mitigates common vulnerabilities like phishing, brute-force
      attacks, and credential stuffing. Methods such as biometric verification
      (e.g., fingerprints and facial recognition), one-time codes, and
      cryptographic keys ensure stronger and more reliable user authentication.

    <p class="c">
      From a user perspective, it simplifies the login process, removing the
      need to remember or reset complex passwords, resulting in faster and
      smoother authentication. Additionally, it reduces operational costs for
      businesses by minimizing password-related IT support requests.
    </p>
    <p class="c">
      However, the adoption of passwordless systems presents challenges,
      including dependency on hardware devices, integration with legacy systems,
      and concerns over biometric data privacy. Implementing these solutions
      requires significant investment and user adaptation. Despite these
      hurdles, passwordless authentication represents a crucial step toward a
      safer and more seamless digital future.
