      Why is Passwordless Authentication Gaining Traction?/Real-World Example
    </h1>
    <h3 class="p">1. Security Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="d">
        Reduces Phishing and Credential Theft: Without passwords, attackers
        cannot steal them via phishing emails or brute force attacks.
      </li>
      <li class="d">
        Eliminates Password Leaks: No passwords stored means no risks of
        breaches leaking sensitive credentials.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="p">2. Improved User Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="d">
        No need to remember complex passwords or reset forgotten ones.
      </li>
      <li class="d">
        Faster login process using biometrics, passkeys, or devices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="p">Support for Modern Technology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="d">
        Works seamlessly with smartphones, hardware keys, and identity
        verification tools.
      </li>
      <li class="d">
        Supports FIDO2 and WebAuthn, enabling widespread adoption.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="p">Compliance and Adoption</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="d">
        Passwordless solutions align with increasing regulatory demands for
        secure authentication (e.g., GDPR, NIST).
      </li>
      <li class="d">
        Companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple are pushing passwordless
        technologies to enhance security.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Real-World Example:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="d">
        Passkeys: Modern solutions like Apple's iCloud Keychain and Google's
        authentication rely on public-key cryptography to securely verify
        identity without using a password.
      </li>
      <li class="d">
        Passkeys are modern passwordless solutions that use public-key
        cryptography for authentication.
      </li>
      <li class="d">
        Apple’s iCloud Keychain and Google’s Passkey Authentication allow users
        to log in securely using a cryptographic key stored on their device.
      </li>
      <li class="d">
        The public key is shared with the server, while the private key remains
        securely stored on the user’s device.
      </li>
    </ul>
