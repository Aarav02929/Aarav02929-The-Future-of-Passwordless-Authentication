    <h1>How Does Passwordless Authentication Work?</h1>
    <h2>User Identification</h2>
    <p>
      The user provides their identifier, such as an email address, username, or
      phone number.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      The system generates a unique "challenge," such as a one-time code, push
      notification, or cryptographic request.
    </p>

    <h2>Verification</h2>
    <p>The user completes the verification step:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="i">
        <strong>Biometric Match:</strong> Face or fingerprint scan is verified.
      </li>
      <li class="i">
        <strong>Code Entry:</strong> A one-time passcode is submitted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Response and Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      If the response matches the expected result, the user is granted access.
      The system validates the challenge using cryptographic methods (e.g.,
      private and public key pairs) or token verification.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong class="i"
          >Device Confirmation: Using hardware tokens or cryptographic
          keys.</strong
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
