        <strong>1. Apple’s Leadership in Passwordless Authentication </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Apple has embraced passwordless authentication through its innovative
        Passkeys, available in iOS and macOS systems. By eliminating the need
        for traditional passwords, Apple enhances both security and user
        experience. Passkeys leverage FIDO2 standards, a globally recognized
        framework for secure authentication, making them compatible with various
        platforms and services. This adoption underscores Apple’s commitment to
        advancing digital security.

          >2. Seamless and Secure Logins with Face ID and Touch ID
        </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Passkeys allow users to log in to supported websites and apps using
        biometric authentication methods like Face ID or Touch ID. These methods
        provide a quick, convenient, and secure alternative to typing passwords.
        Biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial scans, never leaves the
        device, ensuring user privacy. With Passkeys, users gain access in
        seconds, enhancing productivity while maintaining high-security
        standards.
      </li>
      <li><strong>3. Synchronized Security with iCloud Keychain </strong></li>
      <li>
        Private keys, essential for Passkey authentication, are securely stored
        in iCloud Keychain. This ensures that users’ credentials remain
        encrypted and inaccessible to anyone but the owner. Passkeys are also
        synchronized across trusted Apple devices, such as iPhones, iPads, and
        Macs, providing seamless access. This cross-device compatibility allows
        users to switch between devices without any disruption, delivering a
        streamlined experience and robust protection against cyber threats.
