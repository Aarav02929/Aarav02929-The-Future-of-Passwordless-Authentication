    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Protection Against Phishing and Credential Theft:</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Since there are no passwords, attackers cannot steal or phish
        credentials.
      </li>
      <li>
        Example: Users verifying via biometric scans or hardware tokens cannot
        be tricked into revealing passwords.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Resilience to Brute Force Attacks:</strong></li>
      <li>
        Password-based systems are vulnerable to brute force attempts where
        attackers guess passwords.
      </li>
      <li>
        Passwordless systems rely on cryptographic keys, biometrics, or one-time
        codes, which are significantly harder to compromise.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Reduced Risk of Data Breaches:</strong></li>
      <li>
        Passwords stored on servers are frequent targets of data breaches.
        Without passwords to store, the risk of sensitive credential leaks is
        minimized.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Eliminates Password Reuse Issues:</strong></li>
      <li>
        Many users reuse passwords across multiple platforms, increasing risk.
        Passwordless methods inherently prevent this issue.
      </li>
    </ul>
